Mobile‑First Audit — Beatful (2025‑10‑25)

Summary
- Goal: Validate and strengthen mobile‑first implementation across layout, viewport, interaction, and performance.
- Outcome: Fixed anti‑pattern in viewport (re‑enabled zoom), improved viewport height handling for the player, and reduced base container padding for smaller screens. Overall architecture is already Tailwind mobile‑first with responsive classes.

Key Findings
- Viewport and Scaling
  - app/layout.tsx exported a viewport with maximumScale: 1 and userScalable: false which disables pinch‑to‑zoom. This is an accessibility anti‑pattern.
  - Safe‑area handling exists via .mobile-safe-area and metadata.

- Layout and Spacing
  - Tailwind usage is mobile‑first with progressive sm:/md:/lg: modifiers.
  - Base container padding was px-8 (2rem) which is a bit heavy on small devices.
  - Several views use min-h-screen (good). The player used h-screen which can cause address‑bar layout issues on iOS/Android.

- Touch Targets and Gestures
  - .touch-target ensures minimum 44×44px, good for mobile ergonomics.
  - Custom touch gesture logic (double tap, pinch, swipe) implemented in ProductivityBinauralPlayer; works well on mobile.

- Typography
  - Global CSS sets comfortable base sizes and smoothing; no “text too small” issues detected. Headings scale up at larger breakpoints.

- Navigation
  - Header collapses to a mobile menu (md:hidden patterns). Buttons/links include .touch-target and sufficient spacing.

- Performance
  - Next.js dynamic import disables SSR for the player route to avoid heavy hydration on initial load. Images are optimized via Next/Image config.
  - Further JS/code‑splitting opportunities exist but are not blockers for mobile‑first.

Changes Implemented
1) Re‑enable user zoom and improve safe‑area viewport
   - app/layout.tsx: removed maximumScale and userScalable, added viewportFit: 'cover'.
   - Rationale: Allow users to zoom for accessibility; avoid blocking device notch handling.

2) Fix viewport height usage in the player
   - components/ProductivityBinauralPlayer.tsx: replaced h-screen with min-h-[100svh] for the main content area.
   - Rationale: svh is more stable on mobile address bar show/hide and prevents layout jumps.

3) Reduce base container padding on small screens
   - app/globals.css: .container-zen, .container-zen-narrow, .container-zen-wide updated from px-8 to px-4 at base, scaling up at sm and beyond.
   - Rationale: Lighter gutter on small devices while keeping generous spacing on larger screens.

Additional Recommendations (Optional)
- Replace other occurrences of h-screen with min-h-[100svh] or min-h-[100dvh] where full‑height sections are used, after visual QA.
- Ensure all Next <Image> usages specify an appropriate sizes prop for better source selection on small screens.
- Audit heavy motion for prefers-reduced-motion users and ensure graceful fallbacks (many are already subtle).
- Consider lazy‑loading non‑critical components below the fold on landing pages.
- Verify the mobile menu and any fixed footers do not overlap primary interactions on small devices with large accessibility text sizes.

Quick Test Matrix (Post‑changes)
- iOS Safari (iOS 16/17):
  - Zoom enabled, no layout break.
  - Player height stable with address bar changes.
- Android Chrome (latest):
  - No 100vh jump; player maintains full‑height feel.
- Small phones (360–390px width):
  - Containers feel less cramped with px-4 base padding.

File References
- app/layout.tsx:140 — export const viewport (updated)
- components/ProductivityBinauralPlayer.tsx:575 — main container height (updated)
- app/globals.css:1424, 1428, 1432 — container paddings (updated)

Status
- Mobile‑first baseline is solid. Immediate accessibility and viewport height improvements are applied and ready for deployment.
